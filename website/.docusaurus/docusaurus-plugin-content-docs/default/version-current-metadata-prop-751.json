We see the Basekamp as a rough but functional starting point to grow from. We converted our basic utilities into two shipping containers! Workspace & Towncenter like in Age of Empires.",

And you don't want to spend too much time thinking about your individual place to sleep. However a good night rest is crucial. Luckily this is something you can prepare in advance, you can make it easier on yourself by living in a Van. Take your comfort with you.",

So in order to accelerate this process we setup a Basekamp. The Basekamp was built in our previous place where we had enough tools to prepare ourselves. We put everything in shipping containers and a Van so it's easy to transport to our new location. Once arrived we plug it in to water and electricity and we are good to go. A place that hosts our basic utilities to get us going.",

And you will need the internet, a diverse skillset of people, engineers, chefs, gardeners, construction workers, lawyers etc. So we advise as a first step to share your intention or idea.

In short we don't like the idea of shipping t-shirts around the world since it has a large environmental impact. (even though it would be a good source of income) We believe there are other creative/less wasteful ways to achieve this. Have a look at fixing.fashion for more information about the issues with the fashion industry and what to do about it. For now we've made an spikey bushes illustration and added a bunch of different files that you can use to stitch, carve, press. Download the package below for free.

They are messy, rough, don't always make sense and could have some dead ends but show what happens behind the scenes. And finally when we have learned our lessons, made our mistakes and found the best way we share our knowledge in main Academy videos. Just trying to make sure you get the difference, wait let me make it more clear.",
