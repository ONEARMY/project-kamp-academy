# project-kamp-academy
Academy for the project kamp project

## Building locally
It isn't particularly well-optimised for external contribution (yet!), but if you really want to try it out:

### Installation

1. Install Node  
   Follow instructions at https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Install Yarn  
   Follow instructions at https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install

3. Clone the repo  
   Either use your favourite git client [client](https://git-scm.com/download/gui) or  
   `git clone https://github.com/ONEARMY/project-kamp-academy.git`
4. Install website dependencies

```
cd project-kamp-academy/website

yarn install
```

### Run locally

```
yarn start
```

### View local changes

The above command will automatically start up a local development server with live-reload, and open in a web browser.
Any changes you make should automatically recompile and refresh your browser window
