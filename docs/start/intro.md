Good to see you here in our Project Kamp Academy. This is the place where we share our developments and steps forward to setup Project Kamp. How to research, how to buy land, how to prototype etc. But before we go in depth, here is a quick overview where we are currently at.


### Goal

The goal of this project is to try to find alternative way to live, one that causes less negative impact on the environment, we don't know what this looks like. But we are doing research, exploring and prototyping it. And the key element is that we share all our development open-source online. So everyone can learn from our mistakes and copy the best things.

### Current stage.

So where are we currently at? Well ... we are still in the early days. We did a lot of research, bought a piece of land and are getting ready to move! Soon more developments will come, the best thing to do is to subscribe on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqA-SppbeUi5ou0isB27mgg). Meanwhile make sure to browse the chapters on the side ðŸ‘ˆ to see where we are at.

### Open source & License

We share everything open source for anyone to use and benefit from. This means that all the knowledge, know-how, processes, methodologies and tools are available online, for free at all times. This open source philosophy is at the core of Project Kamp and shapes most decisions within our team. We believe that collaboration is stronger than competition.
