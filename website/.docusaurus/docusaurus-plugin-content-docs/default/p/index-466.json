This way you can work right away and use all the tools and equipment you need. Not worrying about the basics, this will help to focus on restoring the land as a first priority. We see the Basekamp as a rough but functional starting point to grow from. We converted our basic utilities into two shipping containers! Workspace & Towncenter like in Age of Empires.","sidebar":"docs"},"basekamp/house":{"id":"basekamp/house","title":"House in a Van","description":"Specially in the early days of setting up a community it's hectic. Making sure there is water, a workspace is being setup, the kitchen is running and the showers work. Long days, a lot of physical work, it's tiring. You are working on the shared facilities and infrastructure for the community. And you don't want to spend too much time thinking about your individual place to sleep. However a good night rest is crucial. Luckily this is something you can prepare in advance, you can make it easier on yourself by living in a Van. Take your comfort with you.","sidebar":"docs"},"basekamp/intro":{"id":"basekamp/intro","title":"Introduction","description":"In the early days there is not much on the land, no infrastructure, no kitchen, no shower, no house etc. It's hard to get something going without tools, food and a good sleep. So in order to accelerate this process we setup a Basekamp. The Basekamp was built in our previous place where we had enough tools to prepare ourselves. We put everything in shipping containers and a Van so it's easy to transport to our new location. Once arrived we plug it in to water and electricity and we are good to go. A place that hosts our basic utilities to get us going.","sidebar":"docs"},"explore/auroville":{"id":"explore/auroville","title":"🇮🇳 Auroville in India","description":"🇮🇳 Information Auroville  |     |","sidebar":"docs"},"explore/intro":{"id":"explore/intro","title":"Start exploring","description":"Exploring what is already out there is an important step for starting to setup your own community. There are people all over the world who have already been doing it for years. There is already a lot of technology, structures and system figured out along the way. That said the downside is that very little of this information can be found online, it's a lot in the minds of older generation.","sidebar":"docs"},"explore/krishna":{"id":"explore/krishna","title":"🇮🇳 Life in a Krishna temple","description":"🇮🇳 Information Krishna Consciousness  |     |","sidebar":"docs"},"explore/preciousplastic":{"id":"explore/preciousplastic","title":"🇳🇱 Precious Plastic V4","description":"🇳🇱 Information Precious Plastic V4  |     |","sidebar":"docs"},"explore/tamera":{"id":"explore/tamera","title":"🇵🇹 Tamera in Portugal","description":"🇵🇹 Information Tamera|     |","sidebar":"docs"},"guides/research":{"id":"guides/research","title":"Guidelines + tips for a research (draft)","description":"What is a research?"},"index":{"id":"index","title":"Project Kamp Academy","description":"Good to see you here in our Project Kamp Academy. This is the place where we share our developments and steps forward to setup Project Kamp. How to research, how to buy land, how to prototype etc. But before we go in depth, here is a quick overview where we are currently at.","sidebar":"docs"},"land/buy":{"id":"land/buy","title":"Buying land","description":"After you have visualised that raw idea in your mind and shared your plan with others it's time for the big thing. Finding a piece of land. In this video we will explain how to do this step by step. From researching which land you need, to actually visiting the land and finally the buying process. Seeing how to set a price, where to look out for and what additional costs you will have. Below we will also go a bit more in depth on some documents that can be useful to use.","sidebar":"docs"},"land/share":{"id":"land/share","title":"Share your idea","description":"Starting a community is a big project, you need money, to build houses, to fix legal paperwork etc. It can easily be overwhelming to start. But the good thing is, you are not alone. There are plenty of like minded people out there and the internet is a powerful tool which you can use. And you will need the internet, a diverse skillset of people, engineers, chefs, gardeners, construction workers, lawyers etc. So we advise as a first step to share your intention or idea. Explain what you want to do and what you need. Let others be a part of the journey.","sidebar":"docs"},"start/intro":{"id":"start/intro","title":"Hello ✋","description":"Good to see you here in our Project Kamp Academy.

We use Discord to chat, learn from each other and answer questions. Besides the practical stuff it's also a great place to meet like-minded people and get inspired by other projects. Have a look, join our +10.000 people Discord and get in touch with the community!","sidebar":"docs"},"support/download":{"id":"support/download","title":"Download Kit","description":"Project Kamp is just getting started. The download kit is small and in the early stages. But hey, you got to start somewhere. So here you can download everything we got so far. Thank you for seeing potential this early on, keeps us motivated to continue development! :)","sidebar":"docs"},"support/merch":{"id":"support/merch","title":"Spikey Booshes Merch","description":"After lots of requests from our community we finally made it! SPIKEY BOOSHES merch. Well sort of, we explain more about it in update #118 . In short we don't like the idea of shipping t-shirts around the world since it has a large environmental impact. (even though it would be a good source of income) We believe there are other creative/less wasteful ways to achieve this. Have a look at fixing.fashion for more information about the issues with the fashion industry and what to do about it. For now we've made an spikey bushes illustration and added a bunch of different files that you can use to stitch, carve, press. Download the package below for free. Share what you made with it on #spikeybooshes","sidebar":"docs"},"updates/video":{"id":"updates/video","title":"Updates","description":"To make sure we properly document and archive everything we started doing update videos. These videos are a chronological way to keep track of our development and documentation. Some work we do will take years to complete, for instance \"transforming dead soil to a forest\". In these update videos you can follow us along the way.  They are messy, rough, don't always make sense and could have some dead ends but show what happens behind the scenes. And finally when we have learned our lessons, made our mistakes and found the best way we share our knowledge in main Academy videos. Just trying to make sure you get the difference, wait let me make it more clear.","sidebar":"docs"}}}}
