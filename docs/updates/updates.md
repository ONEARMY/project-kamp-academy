To make sure we properly document and archive everything we started update videos. These videos are a chronological way to keep track of our development and documentation. Some work we do will take years to complete, for instance "transforming death soil to a forrest". In these update videos you can follow us along the way.  They are messy rough don't always make sense, could have some death ends but show behind the scenes. And finally when we have learned our lessons, made our mistakes and found the best way we share our knowledge in a main Academy videos. Just trying to make sure you get the difference, wait let me make it more clear.
