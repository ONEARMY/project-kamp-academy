This way you can work right away and use all the tools and equipment you need. Not worrying about the basics, this will help to focus on restoring the land as a first priority. We see the Basekamp as a rough but functional starting point to grow from. We converted our basic utilities into two shipping containers!

Making sure there is water, a workspace is being setup, the kitchen is running and the showers work. Long days, a lot of physical work, it's tiring. You are working on the shared facilities and infrastructure for the community. And you don't want to spend too much time thinking about your individual place to sleep.

So in order to accelerate this process we setup a Basekamp. The Basekamp was built in our previous place where we had enough tools to prepare ourselves. We put everything in shipping containers and a Van so it's easy to transport to our new location. Once arrived we plug it in to water and electricity and we are good to go.
