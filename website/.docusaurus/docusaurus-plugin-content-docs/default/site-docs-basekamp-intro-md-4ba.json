  "description": "In the early days there is not much on the land, no infrastructure, no kitchen, no shower, no house etc. It's hard to get something going without tools, food and a good sleep. So in order to accelerate this process we setup a Basekamp. The Basekamp was built in our previous place where we had enough tools to prepare ourselves. We put everything in shipping containers and a Van so it's easy to transport to our new location. Once arrived we plug it in to water and electricity and we are good to go. A place that hosts our basic utilities to get us going.",
