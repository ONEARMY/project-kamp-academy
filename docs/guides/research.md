## What is a research?

The research module is made to document ongoing process. It's a journal of development that documents the learnings and mistakes along the way. It's messy, rough and unfiltered. Unlike how-to's where only the final result is shared.

## How to start
The main thing you need for starting a research is a good topic. Something you want to try out and are committed to research.

### 1. Begin ‚ú®
Post a question. Try to define in one sentence the topic you want to research. A question can easily be too big and complex for one individual to solve. It's good to narrow down and keep your research question small and realistic to achieve. Others can build on top of your work.

### 2. Process üìÑ
Do whatever you need to do to answer your question. Make experiments, test prototypes, make pictures, share .pdfs. Whatever you do, make sure to document your learnings along the way like a journal. This is very useful information for the next person having the same question and is a good way for people to help out when you are stuck.

### 3. End üèÅ
It's not necessary to answer your question. It might be too big of a question for one person/topic to answer. This is not a problem, the things you tried and researched are valuable for the next person taking on the task. That said if you do decide to not continue to research make a final post about it. Inform others that this journal stops so someone else can continue in another topic.
