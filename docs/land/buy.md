Steps to buy land


- So we bought this piece of land to start Project Kamp.
- In this video I'll show you the process of doing so.
- intro

***Let me show you how we got it***

- Research what do you want (previous chapter)
- Then you start looking and visiting lands
- And finally the actually buying process with
- Location, where. (soil, climate, accessibility)
- Recommend to pin down country, makes search easier
- Visit and meanwhile make connections.
- luxury of two team members to go a few times ground work.
- Visited in a few days over 30 lands.
- All beautiful
- Practical list. Pro/con 4G, Water, Electricity, public transport etc.
- End of the day. Gut feeling. some just feel better.
- Narrow down.
- Then we decided on this land. We call it treasure stone.

***Let me show you the land***
- The land has a big rock.
- old shred
- water stream
- grass area
- local village, train

***Buying process in Portugal***
- Money for the land
- 110K
- Taxes 6%
- Legal fees 500 Euro
- Local sign up to the country
- Land is bought by foundation. No one owns the land.
- Personally I think you threat it different. Less personal invested or long term worries. Living now, making it happen now. Equal for everyone there
- Sounds expensive. Just an investment. Place will be workspace and house. Living in NL is much more expenive/ rent.
- We didn' have that much money. So a few friends and family chipped in a bit as a loan. I promised to pay everyone back
