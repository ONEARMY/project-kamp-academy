Good to see you here in our Project Kamp Academy. This is the place where we share our developments and steps forward to setup Project Kamp. How to research, how to buy land, how to prototype etc. But before we go in depth, here a quick overview where we are currently at.


### Goal

The goal of this project is trying to find alternative way to live, one that causes less negative impact on the environment, we don't know what this looks like. But we are doing research, exploring and prototyping it. And the key element is that we share all our development open-source online. So everyone can learn from our mistakes and copy the best things.

### Current stage.

So where are we currently at? Well..still in the early days. We did a lot of research, bought a piece of land and are getting ready to move! Soon more developments will come, best is to subscribe on Youtube or join our mailinglist. Meanwhile make sure to browse the chapters on the side ðŸ‘ˆ to see where we are at.

### Get involved?

At the moment there isn't that much help needed since we are still preparing the ground. That said, something that really helps a lot is just liking, sharing and watching the content we put out. Your helping out by educating your mind and spreading the word, which one day will come to use :) Meanwhile you can also visit support.projectkamp.com to see other ways to contribute. Like donating money and joining One Army.

### Questions?

If you have any questions at this stage, we would recommend to watch all the chapters first. BUT if you did that, you can join our Discord to talk about developments.

### One Army.

Project Kamp is a Project from One Army.. but more about that later. Too much for now. Get started with the first chapter, research!
