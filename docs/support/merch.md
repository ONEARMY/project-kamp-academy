After lots of request from our community we finally made it! **SPIKEY BOOSHES** merch. Well sort of, we explain more about it in update [#118](https://fixing.fashion) . In short we don't like the idea of shipping t-shirts around the world since it has a large enviromental impact. (eventhough it would be significant source of income) We believe there are other create ways to use whats already out there. Have a look at [fixing.fashion](https://fixing.fashion) for more information about the issues with the fashion industry and what to do about it. For now we've made an spikey bushes illustration and added a whole bunch of different files that you can use to stitch, carve, press. Download the package below for **free**. Share what you made with it on #spikeybooshes
